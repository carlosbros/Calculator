===========================

Implementation of a stack-based calculator in C.
It interacts with a user from the command-line. The user
must input integers and operators in Reverse Polish notation.

The program stores input numbers in a stack, and every time the
user inputs an operator, that operation is performed using the two
top elements of the stack.
